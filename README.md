# Proactive Human-Manipulator Collision Avoidance

This repository contains the implementation of a real-time, predictive motion planning framework developed for the **UR16e industrial robotic arm** operating in human-shared environments. The goal is to enable **safe and intelligent collaboration** between humans and robots in dynamic workspaces by forecasting human motion and adapting the robot's trajectory accordingly.

The system integrates **3D skeletal pose estimation**, **neural motion prediction**, **Artificial Potential Field (APF) evaluation**, and a **GPU-accelerated A-RRT\*** path planner within a **ROS 2-based digital twin**. All planning and control modules operate in real-time, leveraging sensor fusion and simulation tools to proactively avoid collisions without disrupting the robot’s ongoing tasks.

##  System Architecture

1. Capture 3D skeleton joint positions from RGB-D camera
2. Predict future human motion using LSTM model
3. Evaluate collision risk using APF on predicted joint-robot proximity
4. If risk > threshold → trigger A-RRT\* replan
5. Send new joint trajectory to robot via ROS 2
